# **K-Means Clustering from Scratch**

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on implementing **K-Means clustering from scratch** using R. The objective was to **gain a deep understanding of clustering algorithms** by manually handling centroid initialization, iterative updates, and convergence checks without relying on pre-built ML libraries.  

By applying this approach, we were able to analyze clustering behavior, determine the optimal number of clusters, and visualize centroid movements over iterations. The project also includes **Silhouette Score evaluation** to assess cluster quality and identify the best cluster count.

## **Why This Project?**  
The primary motivation behind this project was to:  
- **Understand the inner workings of K-Means clustering** beyond standard library functions.  
- **Implement clustering from scratch** to develop stronger algorithmic intuition.  
- **Apply and evaluate clustering on synthetic datasets** using data-driven methods.  
- **Visualize the clustering process** to interpret results effectively.  
- **Assess cluster quality** through statistical evaluation techniques.
